## Accept-Reject Continued

(New code that you write for this assignment can be saved in new `*.R` files and pushed back to the repository.)\

1.  Implement an AR algorithm to sample from a Beta$(2, .1)$ distribution. Follow the theory from the notes.\

2.  Using only $U(0,1)$ draws, draw samples from Gamma$(4,3)$ using Accept-Reject and an exponential proposal. Compare the performance of the sampler using the optimal exponential proposal, versus $\lambda = 2$.\

3.  For a $N(0,1)$ target, consider a Cauchy proposal with scale parameter $\sigma$, where the pdf of such a proposal is

    $$
    g(x) = \dfrac{1}{\pi \sigma} \dfrac{1}{(1 + x/\sigma)^2}\,.
    $$

    Find the optimal value of $\sigma$, and implement the AR algorithm for this value.\
